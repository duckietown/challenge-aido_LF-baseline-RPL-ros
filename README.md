## Baseline using RPL over ros for challenge [`aido_LF`][lf], [`aido_LFV`][lfv] and [`aido_LFVI`][lfvi]

You may reference this doc for the ROS part of this baseline. [This code is documented here](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/AIDO/out/ros_template.html).

Your agent may be submitted using `dts challenges submit`. This will copy over the `launchers`, `rl_agent`, and all root-level
files into the submission docker. This will not copy over the `local_dev` directory.

To learn how actually train and test your agent, check out the README.md inside of `local_dev`.
